I'm Marcus Henriksbø, just graduated from an integrated master's programs in Computer Science (specializing in AI) and currently pursuing a integrated master's in Industrial Economics and Technology Management at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I'm writing my thesis there the coming year on responsible AI. 

Beyond the academic world, my passion also lies in management and organizing skills that have been honed through various volunteer positions, having held key roles in ISFiT, the world's largest international student festival, and Revolve NTNU, a top Formula Student team. I'm also an active member of Effective Altruism, where I engage in meaningful conversations on optimizing for good.

My technical expertise includes Machine learning (NLP, some CV and timeseries), Full-stack (React.js, Django, SQL or noSQL), lots of Python, and internships and positions at organizations such as Norges Bank Investment Management (Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the oil und) and Cognite (Norways first unicorn, SaaS company).
